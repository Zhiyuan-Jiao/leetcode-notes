class Solution:
    def coinChange(self, coins: List[int], amount: int) -> int:
        dp = [amount + 1] * (amount + 1)
        dp[0] = 0
        for a in range(1, amount + 1):
            for c in coins:
                if a - c >= 0:
                    dp[a] = min(dp[a], 1 + dp[a - c])
        return dp[amount] if dp[amount] != amount + 1 else - 1

# Algorithm: DP bottom up compute the smallest quantity of coins to get the that amount from the 0 to the number
# Time complexity: O(amount *  coins)
# Space complexity: O(amount)
